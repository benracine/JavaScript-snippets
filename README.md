# Purpose

This page is just a central location for me to share JavaScript snippets with a friend.

# Installation
- Install node.js from [here](http://nodejs.org/).

# Getting up and running
- Copy the `helloworld.js` file to your local file system and run it with `node helloworld.js` from the command line.

# Libraries
- Node.js comes with its own libraries for many common tasks. They are documented [here](http://nodejs.org/api/).
- Further, the community develops 3rd party applications in a rather organized way using the npm package management system [here](https://www.npmjs.org/).
